# Self-healing patch of plugin.video.pov's sources.py so that when
# POV picks a source from the source-select dialog, it stashes the
# picked release name + URL in a Kodi Window(10000) property right
# before yielding the link to the player.
#
# Why: DarkSubs runs as a separate addon (separate Python process
# when its subtitle.module is dispatched) and reads
# xbmc.Player().getPlayingFile() to get the filename for matching
# subtitle release names by token overlap. For TorBox sources the
# CDN URL is opaque (`store-N.torbox.app/<uuid>?token=...`) so the
# basename is just a UUID and the matcher gets 0% every time. For
# RD/AD the URL has the release filename but it might be a slightly
# different transliteration than the source POV originally picked.
#
# Either way, the cleanest filename to feed the matcher is the one
# POV itself picked from the user's source list (item['name'] inside
# the `_process` generator in `play_file`). That release name is
# guaranteed to contain the full token set the subtitle release names
# were authored against (encoder, source, group, etc).
#
# Window properties on Window(10000) are persistent across the
# addon-dispatch boundary, so DarkSubs can read them via
# `xbmc.Window(10000).getProperty('pov_picked_source_name')`. We
# also write the picked URL alongside the name so DarkSubs can
# verify that the property is for the *current* playback and not a
# stale value from an earlier POV play.
#
# Self-healing: re-applies on every Kodi startup. If POV upstream
# restructures _process() or play_file() in a way our pattern
# doesn't match, we skip with a log warning and the TorBox fallback
# in darksubs_filename_fallback_patcher carries on by synthesising
# a filename from VideoPlayer info-labels (lower-fidelity but better
# than 0%).
