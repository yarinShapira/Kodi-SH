# Arabic roots for severe policy-trigger terms (sexual violence / torture /

# we OMIT just that line from the prompt. Rationale, validated live against the
# API: the prompt-level PROHIBITED_CONTENT block is driven by the VOLUME of
# explicit terms in one request; the English subtitle alone translates fine
# (it stays under the threshold), but the Arabic reference REPEATS those same
# explicit terms and tips it over. The Arabic is only a gender oracle, and for
# these specific lines the gender is virtually always clear from context anyway
# (e.g. an established female victim), so dropping them removes the block trigger
# while keeping gender correct (confirmed: feminine forms stayed right with the

# keep-source cascade remains as a safety net for anything that still blocks.
