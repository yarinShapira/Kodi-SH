# Self-healing patch of DarkSubs's engine.py so that EMBEDDED
# ("[LOC]") subtitle entries sink to the BOTTOM of their language
# group in the results dialog instead of floating to the top.
#
# The problem:
#   DarkSubs (All_Subs/autosub.py) injects an embedded-stream entry
#   into the results with a hard-coded sync percent of 101 and
#   site_id '[LOC]'. The list builder in engine.py sorts each
#   language group by descending sync percent (-x[5]), so 101 always
#   wins -- the embedded English line lands FIRST in the English
#   group. On this POV/streaming build the embedded track is almost
#   always identical to (or worse than) an external English sub, and
#   crucially DarkSubs's download_sub() short-circuits embedded picks
#   with setSubtitleStream() + 'EmbeddedSubSelected' BEFORE
#   machine_translate_subs runs -- so picking it never reaches our AI
#   hook and the user is stuck with untranslated English. Users keep
#   landing on it by reflex because it's at the top.
#
# The fix:
#   Inject ONE statement immediately after engine.py's
#   `english_subtitles = custom_sort(english_subtitles, ...)` line that
#   stable-re-sorts ONLY the English group so '[LOC]' entries fall to its
#   bottom. External English subs (OpenSubtitles, YIFY, ...) keep their
#   relative order and now sit above the embedded English line, so the
#   AI-translatable source is the natural first pick. The embedded entry
#   is still present -- just last in its group.
#
# CRITICAL -- why we scope to English only (not the combined list):
#   DarkSubs stamps site_id '[LOC]' on BOTH embedded-English AND
#   embedded-Hebrew entries. A Hebrew embedded track is the BEST pick
#   (native Hebrew, perfectly synced, zero translation) and MUST stay at
#   the very top. engine.py's concat (`hebrew + telegram_mt + english +
#   other`) already guarantees the whole Hebrew group outranks English,
#   and the embedded Hebrew entry's 101% floats it to the top OF that
#   group. If we re-sorted the COMBINED list by '[LOC]' we'd sink the
#   Hebrew embedded entry below English -- the opposite of what we want.
#   Re-sorting english_subtitles alone leaves Hebrew completely untouched.
#
# Self-healing + safety:
#   * Idempotent via marker; re-applies every Kodi startup (DarkSubs
#     updates wipe our line).
#   * Regex match of the english_subtitles sort line is whitespace-
#     tolerant. EXACTLY ONE match required or we bail untouched.
#   * .pyc cache invalidated so DarkSubs's reuselanguageinvoker
#     interpreter recompiles from the new source (same pitfall the
#     other DarkSubs patchers handle).
#   * No-op (returns a status, writes nothing) when DarkSubs isn't
#     installed or its engine.py has been refactored beyond what we
#     recognise -- the dialog just keeps DarkSubs's native ordering.

# v2 -- why the v1 (english-group-only) demote did not help this user:
#   The embedded entry is classified into a language group SOLELY by its
#   label/url string (its url is an integer stream index, not
#   'language=English', so engine.py's `'English' in label` /
#   `'Hebrew' in label` checks decide the bucket). On a Hebrew Kodi the
#   embedded English track's label is the Hebrew phrase
#   "תרגום מובנה אנגלית" -- which contains neither the ASCII word
#   'English' nor 'Hebrew', so it does NOT land in english_subtitles
#   (where v1 re-sorted) and instead floats ABOVE the English subs.
#   That's exactly the user's report: the embedded "תרגום מובנה אנגלית"
#   sits above every real English subtitle.
#
# v2 fix -- anchor on the COMBINE line
#   `sorted_subtitles = hebrew_subtitles + telegram_... + english_... +
#    other_languages_subtitles`
#   and inject ONE stable re-sort of the whole combined list that sinks
#   to the bottom ONLY the [LOC] embedded entries whose LABEL marks them
#   as English (ASCII 'English'/'Eng' or Hebrew 'אנגלית'). A stable sort
#   keeps every other entry's order, so:
#     * a genuine embedded HEBREW track ([LOC] with a Hebrew/'עברית'
#       label, NOT 'אנגלית') keeps its top position -- still the best
#       pick, untouched;
#     * online English/Hebrew providers keep their order;
#     * only the embedded-English line drops to the bottom, regardless of
#       which language bucket engine.py happened to file it under.
#
# This is robust to the misclassification because it acts on the final
# combined list by label, not on one pre-sorted group.
