# Background daemon: prune the translation cache on Kodi start, then
# again every 24h while Kodi is running. Lightweight -- one stat
# pass over a small directory and we're done. Exits if Kodi tells
# us to shut down via Monitor.abortRequested().
#
# Everything is wrapped in try/except so a bug here can't take
# the rest of Kodi down with it.
#
# First-run disable: if a `.disable_on_first_run` marker file is
# present in the addon's directory (placed there by the rollout-1
# quick_update patch), this daemon disables itself the moment it
# wakes up and removes the marker. That way existing users get the
# addon installed but inactive, so they can review before opting in.
# Fresh Install builds never ship the marker, so they rely on Kodi's
# default "new user addons start disabled" behaviour.

# here -- the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard would skip main()
# entirely. Call it directly.
main()
