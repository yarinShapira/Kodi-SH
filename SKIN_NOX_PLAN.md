# NOX Skin (4th skin) — Implementation Plan & Widget Mapping

Status: STAGES 1–4 BUILT (shipped in wizard 0.1.20 / build 0.1.47 /
quickfix 0.1.155 + dist/Kodi-SH-NOX-skin-pack.zip). STAGE 5 (device
render/RTL test) pending — to be done by the user on a real device.

## What shipped
- `skin.povil.nox` v1.0.0: rebranded + scrubbed Estuary MOD. font.py
  side-loader deleted; all foreign plugin calls (plugin.program.Anonymous,
  Settingz-Anon) neutralized/mapped; AnonymousTV branding scrubbed.
- Home widgets remapped: novix→POV (130, mechanical, same TMDB scheme),
  telemedia→idanplus (81, best-effort TV/VOD), drax/flashstream/misc→POV
  (76), watchnixtoons→otaku (3). Final home targets are only pov/idanplus/
  otaku/youtube — all shipped addons. Zero new XML parse errors.
- Hosted as a single on-demand pack `dist/Kodi-SH-NOX-skin-pack.zip`
  (~24 MB). NOT bundled in the base build/APK.
- Wizard (0.1.20): generic `_ensure_packs_installed()` shared by AF3 and
  NOX; `ensure_nox_installed()`; `NOX_PACKS`; Switch-Skin entry
  "סקין NOX - עברית מלאה (ניסיוני)"; first-launch skin list updated.

## Known limitations (v1, refine after device test)
- `script.embuary.info` is NOT bundled — only used by DialogVideoInfo
  (not the home), so the skin loads fine; the enhanced info dialog may
  show empty fields. Add the addon to the pack later if desired.
- telemedia→idanplus is best-effort: Israeli rows collapse to idanplus
  TV/VOD entry points, not their exact sub-catalogs (their content was
  proprietary, no equivalent).
- Base is Nexus-era Estuary on Omega: watch for per-control glitches.

(Original planning analysis below.)

## Goal

Add a 4th, on-demand skin to the build — the "NOX" look the user likes —
installed only when the user picks it from the wizard's **Switch Skin**
menu, exactly like Arctic Fuse 3 (AF3). It must not bloat the base build
for users who never select it.

## Key finding: what "NOX" actually is

The source is `skin.anonymoustv` (from the AnonymousTV build, downloaded
with the user's own subscription for read-only inspection). Despite the
"nox" nickname, its own `addon.xml` declares it a **modified Kodi Estuary
skin** ("Estuary MOD by Ivar Brandt", source github.com/xbmc/skin.estuary).
It is a "mega-skin" bundling several home layouts; the one the user likes
is `xml/Home_nox.xml` + `Custom_nox_main_menu.xml`.

Facts:
- Base: Estuary for **Kodi 20 (Nexus)**. Our build is **Kodi 21 (Omega)** —
  expect minor compatibility fixes.
- Size: ~24 MB zipped → fits in a SINGLE on-demand pack (unlike AF3's 4).
- Skin `<requires>`: `xbmc.gui`, `script.fentastic.helper` (already shipped).
- Also references `script.embuary.info` (~20 refs) — bundle it in the pack
  or strip those references.
- Hebrew: proper `resources/language/resource.language.he_il/strings.po`
  (196 strings) + Hebrew fonts (Heebo/Noto). RTL relies on Kodi's built-in
  language mirroring + the bundled fonts.

## MUST SCRUB before shipping (security)

`skin.anonymoustv/media/buttons/font.py` contains a side-loader:
- `gdrive()` downloads `n.zip` from `github.com/vip200/victory` into
  `addons/packages`.
- `fix()` force-enables `repository.gaia.2`.
Remove this file (and any `xbmc.service`/startup hook referencing it) and
strip all AnonymousTV branding. Do NOT ship their wizard or any phone-home.

## Skin package design (mirror AF3)

- New addon id: `skin.povil.nox` (label e.g. "Kodi-SH — NOX"). Rebrand
  `addon.xml` id/name/provider; bump version; keep GPL/CC-BY-SA license
  + Estuary attribution (GPL requirement).
- Host one zip at `dist/Kodi-SH-NOX-skin-pack.zip` (raw GitHub URL,
  same `AF3_PACK_BASE_URL` base). Include `script.embuary.info` if kept.
- Wizard wiring (resources/libs/wizard.py), copying the AF3 pattern:
  - Add a `NOX_PACKS`-style list (single pack) with `sentinel` =
    `special://home/addons/skin.povil.nox/addon.xml`, `expected_version`,
    and `addon_ids` (the skin + embuary.info if bundled).
  - Add `ensure_nox_installed()` mirroring `ensure_arctic_fuse_3_installed()`
    (download → extract.all → register+enable in Addons DB → UpdateLocalAddons).
    The DB-register step is CRITICAL: without it Kodi silently falls back
    to Estuary (the same bug AF3 hit).
  - In `build_switch_skin()`: add `'סקין NOX - ...': 'skin.povil.nox'`
    to `skin_mapping`, and call `ensure_nox_installed()` before switching,
    like the `skin.arctic.fuse.3` branch does.
  - Update the Switch-Skin notification text (currently lists 3 skins).
  - Add a `media/builds_favourites_xml/skin.povil.nox/favourites.xml`
    and ensure `update_favourites_xml_file()` handles it.

## Home menu widget mapping (approved: keep their layout, remap to POV/idanplus)

Their `Home_nox.xml` widgets target two content addons we must remap:

### A) plugin.video.novix  →  plugin.video.pov   (NEAR-MECHANICAL)
novix and POV share the SAME TMDB scheme (same `action`/`genre_id`/
`network_id`). Confirmed against our working FENtastic→POV wiring:
- `novix ?action=tmdb_movies_genres&genre_id=N&mode=build_movie_list`
  → `pov  ?action=tmdb_movies_genres&genre_id=N&mode=build_movie_list`
- `novix ?action=tmdb_tv_genres&genre_id=N&mode=build_tvshow_list`
  → `pov  ?action=tmdb_tv_genres&genre_id=N&mode=build_tvshow_list`
- `novix ?action=tmdb_movies_networks&network_id=N&mode=build_movie_list`
  → `pov  ?action=tmdb_tv_networks&network_id=N&mode=build_tvshow_list`
    (POV network browsing is under tmdb_tv_networks; verify per row)
- Genre IDs are TMDB-standard and identical, so values carry over.
Implementation: regex transform `plugin.video.novix` → `plugin.video.pov`,
then verify each distinct action/mode against POV's actual routes (cross-
check with FENtastic's proven paths — see list below).

Proven POV paths already used by FENtastic (reuse these verbatim):
- Movies root:  `?name=32028&iconImage=movies&mode=navigator.main&action=MovieList`
- Shows root:   `?name=32029&iconImage=tv&mode=navigator.main&action=TVShowList`
- Genres:       `?menu_type=movie|tvshow&mode=navigator.genres&name=32470`
- Popular movies: `?action=tmdb_movies_popular&mode=build_movie_list&name=32459`
- Trending shows: `?action=trakt_tv_trending&mode=build_tvshow_list&name=32458`
- TV premieres:  `?action=tmdb_tv_premieres&mode=build_tvshow_list&name=32460`
- Latest movies: `?action=tmdb_movies_latest_releases&mode=build_movie_list&name=32461`
- Networks (TV): `?action=tmdb_tv_networks&network_id=N&mode=build_tvshow_list`
- In-progress:   `?action=in_progress_movies&mode=build_movie_list&name=32476`
- Next episodes: `?mode=build_next_episode&name=32483`
- Connect services: `?mode=myservices` (or navigator.build_shortcut_folder_list)

### B) plugin.video.telemedia  →  plugin.video.idanplus   (BEST-EFFORT)
telemedia is AnonymousTV's proprietary Israeli/IPTV addon (modes 251/254/
261/303/312, with pastebin/m3u/Telegram sources). NO 1:1 equivalent. Map
their Israeli rows to idanplus's top entry points (idanplus uses simple
integer modes, confirmed from FENtastic favourites):
- idanplus TV:    `?mode=1&name=...&url=&module=&moredata=`
- idanplus VOD:   `?mode=2&name=...&url=&module=&moredata=`
- idanplus Radio: `?mode=3&name=...&url=&module=&moredata=`
We cannot reproduce telemedia's exact sub-catalogs; collapse the Israeli
rows to these idanplus entries. Drop any pure-IPTV/proprietary tiles that
have no idanplus equivalent.

### Other addons seen
- `plugin.video.idanplus` — already in our build (some widgets map directly).
- `watchnixtoons2`, `drax`, `flashstream`, `specialfeatures` etc. — not in
  our build; drop or point at the nearest POV equivalent.

## Staging (each stage independently verifiable)

1. Skin package: copy skin.anonymoustv → rebrand id/name → SCRUB font.py +
   branding → fix Nexus→Omega issues → zip as dist pack. (Structural verify.)
2. Widget remap: apply novix→POV transform + telemedia→idanplus in the
   NOX home XMLs; build a he_il-clean labels pass.
3. Wizard integration: NOX pack list + ensure_nox_installed() + switch_skin
   entry + favourites. (Mirror AF3, reuse its DB-register fix.)
4. Hosting + build.txt/version bumps as needed.
5. DEVICE TEST PASS (required): verify it renders, RTL correct, home widgets
   populate from POV/idanplus, switch-skin round-trips, no fallback to
   Estuary. Only after this → wide release.

## Open risks
- Nexus-based Estuary on Omega may need per-control fixes.
- POV network browsing path per-row needs verification (movies vs tv).
- RTL correctness can only be confirmed on a real device.
